          If your pool isnt ready to be opened and removing all the water/debris off the cover is going to be a giant pain then Have us do it.  
          We dont just remove the debris from the cover we also give a full inspection and add treatment chemicals to hav the pool open up 
          A lot clearer than it would without it.

      How Much Will this Cost?
    </h3>
    <v-container>
      <div>
        According to fixr, the national average cost for opening a pool is $300. Unfortunately, home services across the board are higher in Long Island. The price is closer to about $400. A basic opening ranges between $300 and $500. More complex openings with attached spas, raised walls, or more advanced equipment will likely run you greater than $500.

        Also, keep in mind that additional recommended services can range between $60 and $300 (filter cleanings, salt system start-ups, the addition of premium chemicals, etc). The overall cost depends on all the factors above.
        Cost of our pool opening extras:

        Fee for extra pump/s – $30 per additional pump
        Safety cover with cable attachment (raised wall) – $30 per 10 feet

          <v-expansion-panel
            title="How would i know if there is too much water and debbris on the cover?"
            text="Debris isnt really a problem what is the problem usually is the combination of large puddles of water 
            and the debri making it heavy and difficult by clogging the filter.  And if that water on the cover gets in that pool then 
            that could potentially make clearing the water more difficult.  So if there is no large puddles of water then there is 99% likelihood
            that there will be no extra fee."
