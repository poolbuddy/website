          <h1>Power Vacuums</h1>
          <h3>Usually in the begining of the season is when most of the powervacuums occur because of the length of time the water sits without chemicals while sometimes
             having fine debris sift through the mesh safety cover.  They are also needed if for some reason you get a lot of sand or other fine sedement in your pool 
             which are usually too much for the weekly maintenanc vacuums. they could also be nessecary if you need to use Flocculant in your pool if the water is keeping
              algae or some other cloudiness or unpleasant hue to the water that is not being removed in a timely enough manner Floccu,ant can be employed to remedy that situation.

              text="Debris isnt really a problem what is the problem usually is the combination of large puddles of water 
              and the debri making it heavy and difficult by clogging the filter.  And if that water on the cover gets in that pool then 
              that could potentially make clearing the water more difficult.  So if there is no large puddles of water then there is 99% likelihood
              that there will be no extra fee."
