      <h1>
     How Much Does a Pool Closing Cost?
    </h1>
    <p> According to HomeAdvisor, the national average cost for opening a pool is $250. Unfortunately, home services across the board are higher in Long Island. The price is closer to about $400. A basic closing ranges between $300 and $500. More complex closings with attached spas, raised walls, or more advanced equipment will likely run you greater than $500.
Also, keep in mind that additional recommended services can range between $30 and $300 (filter cleanings, winterizing more complex systems, the addition of premium chemical bundles, etc). The overall cost depends on all the factors above.

          <v-expansion-panel
            title="What month do you close your pool?"
            text="
                  Here in the northeast (Long Island), we typically close pools around October.
                  However, we recommend closing as late as possible so that the water temperature is lower (less chance of algae blooming under the cover when you close later).
                  We’ve even closed pools in late December – so it’s really up to you (reach out about our pool heater service if you want to extend your season!)."

          <v-expansion-panel
            title="How do you close a pool by yourself?"
            text="
Closing a pool by yourself is a formidable task – but with perseverance, determination, and some careful planning – it can be done. Here’s a general overview:
    Balance the water chemistry and add winterizing chemicals
    Clean the pool and lower the water level
    Remove ladder and handrails
    Disconnect the filter, pump, and peripherals
    Clean the filter and filter tank
    Drain, dry and winterize the plumbing (blow-out the lines)
    Turn off your heater gas valve
    Place the multiport valve in the closed position
    Install the winter pool cover
    Put the pump, chlorinator, and salt cell away for the winter"
          ></v-expansion-panel>
          <v-expansion-panel
            title="Should I shock the pool before closing it?"
            text="Yes, you should shock the pool before closing it. Adding sanitizer will help control any bacteria or algae that may be lingering in the water.
We recommend raising the free available chlorine level up to at least 3 ppm at closing time."
          ></v-expansion-panel>
          <v-expansion-panel
            title="What happens if you don’t close your pool?"
            text="Don’t even think of not closing your pool!
                  Pipes and lines can freeze and burst, you could get an algae infestation, your expensive filtration equipment will get damaged…all bad things!
                  If you don’t awnt to close your pool, please give us a call and let us handle it for you."
