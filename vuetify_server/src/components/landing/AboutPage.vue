            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>I and used to swim at my aunts pool in ronkonkoma. One summer she couldnt find anyone to take care of it so I did.  
              Problems came up but they got fixed, sometimes with help.  I began to start maintaining other pools in the neighborhood.
              I left to go in to the military then got associates in engineering and computer science  at SCCC and a bachalors of Comp Sci 
              from X using my GI Bill.   in the pool industry as well various fields of construction and technology I can pass that value to homeowners of long island.  Starting with building a 
              web app with convient customer expeirience for getting estimates, purchasing items and scheduling services.
