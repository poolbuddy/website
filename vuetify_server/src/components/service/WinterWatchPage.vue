         text="

Even if you have always managed the pool over the winter, it doesn’t mean that you have to keep doing it. Let us take the load off your shoulders so you can rest easy knowing you don’t need to go out in the cold, snow, or rain to deal with the pool.

The time it takes to clean a pool varies with the amount of debris removal needed, but a typical 16×32 in-ground pool takes about 1.5 hours on average.

         title="When do you come for the visits?"
         text="

You have control of how often we come!

OPTION 1: A package of 3 or 5 visits over the winter which is billed upfront.
– 3 visit package = $357 ($119/visit)
– 5 visit package = $495 ($99/visit)

OPTION 2: Booking individual visits as you need them and billed at $149 per visit.

We will work with you to find out when the pool was closed and when your anticipated opening date is so we can plan your winter watch visits accordingly.

         title="What if we have heavy rain, snowfall, or winds…can I adjust my visits?"
         text="Yes! If you want to adjust your scheduled visits due to the weather, just give us a call or text and we can move up your next appointment to a sooner date."

       <v-expansion-panel
         title="What if I don’t need all of the visits in the package I purchased?"
         text="We will not offer credits or refunds on the 3 or 5 visit packages. If you are unsure if you will need all the visits, we would suggest booking individual visits as needed.."

         title="If I enroll in the winter watch program will my pool open up clean in the spring?"
         text="

There is never a guarantee of how a pool will open in the spring. Different cover types, the condition of the pool at closing, and the date of opening all factor into the condition of the pool.

But by enrolling in the winter watch program, you give yourself the best chance of an easier/ quicker opening. By removing the water and debris on the cover that would normally end up in the pool, you are one step closer to your first swim of the season.

       <v-expansion-panel
         title="Do I need to put chemicals in my pool during the winter?"
         text="

You should do your best to make sure your water remains balanced during the winter months. If your water chemistry is not balanced, it can lead to scaling or corrosion of the pool or liner.

You should also make sure the free chlorine level stays near 3 ppm to keep bacteria and algae from growing.

       ></v-expansion-panel>
       <v-expansion-panel
         title="Is it OK to leave water in the pool during winter?"
         text="

Yes! You absolutely want to keep water in the pool during the winter. Without water, the pool will certainly be damaged and could be destroyed altogether.

It is necessary to keep water in the pool at an appropriate water level in order for damage not to occur.

         title="How often should you service your pool in the winter?"
         text="Once or twice a month should be all it takes to make sure your pool is in good shape throughout the winter. Even a brief visual inspection is extremely helpful in preventing any serious problems from going unnoticed."
